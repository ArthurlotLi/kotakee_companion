Description:

The process for generating a new KotakeeOS deep learning model for use with
real time voice input is as follows. (In broad terms)

1. Generate raw_data samples and place in their respective folders in 
raw_data. This has already been done once, so you can choose to add to the
existing pool or create a new one (please don't toss anything away, though).

2. Run trigger_word_detection.py. You will want to specify various parameters
relating to both the creation of the dataset and the training of the model. 
Rest assured that any dataset and model created will be saved and can be 
reused. 

3. With the new model created, go to speechServer/triggerWord and run the 
python program with the iteration number that you used for the above step. 
That's all there is to it. Repeat until you have a model that you love.
